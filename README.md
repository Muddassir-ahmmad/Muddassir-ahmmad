## 🛠️ Featured Projects

📚 Student Report System (In Development)

A full-stack style project built using C++ as the backend engine and HTML/CSS for the UI layer.
Currently building out:

🔐 Student data creation, search, and update modules

📄 JSON-based data storage pipeline

🌐 Interactive HTML front-end connected with C++ processing

⚙️ Scalable structure for future features like authentication & admin panel

Goal: Deliver a fully functional web-style student management workflow powered by a C++ backend.

This one’s still cooking — shipping incremental commits as I build.
